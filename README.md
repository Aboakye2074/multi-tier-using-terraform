# Prerequisites 🚨

### Before you get started, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

####    Terraform installed.
####    AWS IAM credentials configured.
####    Git for cloning the repository. <br/>

# ☁️ WEB TIER ☁️
### The Web Tier is the entry point for incoming user requests. It typically includes:

####   ⚫Load Balancer: Distributes traffic across multiple web servers.
####   ⚫Auto Scaling: Automatically adjusts the number of web servers based on traffic.
####   ⚫Security Groups: Controls incoming and outgoing traffic to the web servers.

# 🚀 Application Tier 🚀

### The Application Tier hosts the application servers responsible for running business logic and interacting with the database tier. Key components include:

####   ⚫Application Servers: These run your application code and can be horizontally scaled.
####   ⚫Load Balancer: Distributes traffic to the application servers.
####   ⚫Auto Scaling: Automatically adjusts the number of web servers based on traffic.
####   ⚫Security Groups: Controls incoming and outgoing traffic to the application servers.

# 💾 Database Tier 💾

### The Database Tier stores and manages our application data. We use Amazon RDS for a managed database service. Key components include:

####   ⚫Amazon RDS: A managed database service for MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQL Server databases.
####   ⚫Security Groups: Control incoming and outgoing traffic to the database.

# 🔧 Terraform Configuration 🔧

### The Terraform configuration for this project is organized into different resources to create the necessary AWS infrastructure components. Key resources include:

####   ⚫Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
####   ⚫Subnets and Route Tables
####   ⚫Security Groups and Network ACLs
####   ⚫Load Balancers
####   ⚫Auto Scaling Groups
####   ⚫RDS Database Instances

# 🚀 Deployment 🚀

### Follow these steps to deploy the architecture:

####   ⚫Clone the repository

####   ⚫Make changes as per your needs.

####   ⚫Initialize Terraform and apply the configuration:

####   ⚫terraform init

####   ⚫Review the changes and confirm.

# 💼 Usage 💼

### Scaling

####   ⚫To scale the Web or Application Tier, use Auto Scaling configurations provided in the respective Terraform files. Adjust the desired capacity to match your scaling requirements.

### Database Management

####   ⚫Access the Amazon RDS instance in the Database Tier to manage your data.

### Load Balancing

####   ⚫Configure the load balancer in the Web and Application Tiers to distribute traffic evenly.

### Security Considerations

####   ⚫Review and customize the security groups and network ACLs to meet your specific security requirements.
